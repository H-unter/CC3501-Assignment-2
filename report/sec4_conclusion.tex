\section{Conclusion}

The project successfully developed an cost-effective embedded system for monitoring and controlling environmental parameters in tropical plant research. By achieving the primary objectives, the system offers accurate data collection and environmental control, serving as a reliable alternative to expensive commercial solutions. While further refinements are needed to enhance scalability, user-friendliness, and robustness, the project provides a solid foundation for future improvements. With continued development, this system has the potential to a useful tool in environmental research applications.
