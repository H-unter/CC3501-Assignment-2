\section{System Design Overview}

The system was designed around the RP2040 microcontroller, acting as the central 
processing unit for interfacing with a variety of sensors and control devices. 
The design incorporates the SF-5M sap flow sensor, LT-1T leaf temperature sensor, 
and MT-603 load cell to measure various environmental parameters. Each of these 
sensors use different communication protocols, requiring careful consideration of 
power requirements, signal integrity, and communication compatibility. A photo 
of the board is shown in \cref{board_photo} while \cref{block_diagram} 
shows an overview of all the communication systems involved in the design.
