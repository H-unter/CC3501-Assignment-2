As seen in \cref{block_diagram} there were lots of blocks


\textbf{Sensors}

SDI-12

Load Cell (MT603)
analogue signal, therefore requires ADC?

Sap Flow Sensor (SF5)
uses SDI-12

Leaf thermistor
uses SDI-12

\textbf{Things to check:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item is 12V necessary?
    \item should we choose I2C or SPI (or both) as interface between RP2040 and DAC?
    \item do we want bluetooth or wifi?
\end{itemize}
- crystal like in assignment 1?
- ADC for load cell?
