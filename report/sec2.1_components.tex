As seen in \cref{block_diagram} there were lots of blocks


\textbf{Sensors}

SDI-12

    \label{sdi12_timing}
\end{figure}

we used the \code{uart_break()} function to send the break signal, and then used the \code{uart_read_stuff()} function to read the response from the sensor. The response was then parsed to get the data. The timing of the SDI-12 protocol is shown in \cref{sdi12_timing}.

Load Cell (MT603)
analogue signal, therefore requires ADC?

Sap Flow Sensor (SF5)
uses SDI-12

Leaf thermistor
uses SDI-12

\textbf{Things to check:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item is 12V necessary?
    \item should we choose I2C or SPI (or both) as interface between RP2040 and DAC?
    \item do we want bluetooth or wifi?
\end{itemize}
- crystal like in assignment 1?
- ADC for load cell?
